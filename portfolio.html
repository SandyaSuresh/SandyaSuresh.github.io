                    <p> 
                        Made a rig to count the number of cars entering and exiting a parking lot
                        Worked with OpenCV and computer vision algorithms to identify cars exiting and entering the parking lot
                        Worked with a team to work through many failure points of our design including thermal issues and testing issues

                        Developed genetic algorithm that optimized for a series of bits predetermined by the user
                        Graphed the fitness of each generation to show the algorithm's results and determine optimal fitness functions
                        Implemented selection algorithms to narrow down and find the chromosome that would best fulfill our needs

                    <h4>Useless Alarm Clock</h4>
                    <p>
                        Designed an alarm clock that required the user to scan an RFID tag and flip a switch to turn off the alarm.
                        Used timers and interrupts on special function registers with Arduino Unos to detect switch flips
                        Wrote C code to interface the time module with the LCD display and buzzer.
